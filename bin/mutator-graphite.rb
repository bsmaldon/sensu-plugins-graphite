# DESCRIPTION:
#   This mutator is an extension of the OnlyCheckOutput mutator, but
#   modified for Graphite metrics. This mutator only sends event output
#   (so you don't need to use OnlyCheckOutput) and it also modifies
#   the format of the hostname in the output if present.
#
#   Note however that using this mutator as a mutator command can be very
#   expensive, as Sensu has to spawn a new Ruby process to launch this script
#   for each result of a metrics check. Consider instead producing the correct
#   metric names from your plugin and sending them directly to Graphite via the
#   socket handler.
#   See https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sensu-users/1hkRSvL48ck/8Dhl98lR24kJ
#   for more information.
#
# OUTPUT:
#   Sensu event output with all dots changed to underlines in host name
#   If -r or --reverse parameter given script put hostname in reverse order
#   for better Graphite tree view
#
# PLATFORM:
#   all

# DEPENDENCIES:
#   none
